7	Moonlighting	1	In this interlude chapter to the Adventure Zone saga, the mysteries of the universe are revealed to our heroes.	01:03:46	2015-02-11	taz_balance_7.txt
8	Moonlighting	2	Now that they can finally understand like, anything that anybody important is saying, our heroes seek employment in the Bureau of Balance.	01:11:39	2015-02-26	taz_balance_8.txt
9	Moonlighting	3	Having passed the Bureau of Balance’s punishing test of initiation, our heroes stock up on supplies and learn abilities that will help them immeasurably in the future.	01:06:07	2015-03-12	taz_balance_9.txt
10	Murder on the Rockport Limited	1	Our heroes are sent out on their first mission as Reclaimers for the Bureau of Balance. Their initial task is an impossible one: Do they possess the competence required to be on time for a train?	01:06:49	2015-03-19	taz_balance_10.txt
11	Murder on the Rockport Limited	2	Our heroes attempt to make the best out of a swampy situation, and race to Rockport before they miss a fateful train.	01:03:11	2015-03-26	taz_balance_11.txt
12	Murder on the Rockport Limited	3	Our heroes board their fateful train to Neverwinter, and are rude to just about every single person aboard.	00:57:51	2015-04-16	taz_balance_12.txt
13	Murder on the Rockport Limited	4	As you might have guessed from the title of the past few episodes, our heroes’ journey isn’t going to be an especially calm one. Because of all the murder, I mean.	00:55:23	2015-04-23	taz_balance_13.txt
14	Murder on the Rockport Limited	5	The game is afoot! The game of murder-solving, I mean. The game of Dungeons & Dragons has been afoot for a while.	00:56:12	2015-05-07	taz_balance_14.txt

17	Lunar Interlude I: Carnival Chaos	1	In this brief interlude between adventures, our heroes attend an office party — well, a carnival — at the Bureau of Balance’s lunar headquarters.	01:09:20	2015-06-18	taz_balance_17.txt
18	Petals to the Metal	1	In this first chapter in a new Adventure Zone story, Merle, Taako and Magnus are in hot pursuit of a master criminal in the metropolitan city of Goldcliff.	00:59:07	2015-07-02	taz_balance_18.txt
19	Petals to the Metal	2	Our heroes attempt to reconcile with Trent the Treant; a task made difficult by the fact that one of them just cut him in half.	00:54:13	2015-07-16	taz_balance_19.txt
20	Petals to the Metal	3	In this installment, the question isn’t 'Will our heroes survive,' it's, 'What’s going to kill them first?'	00:54:02	2015-07-30	taz_balance_20.txt
21	Petals to the Metal	4	Having straight-up embarrassed themselves in their first encounter with The Raven, our heroes look for alternative methods of defeating her.	01:04:55	2015-08-13	taz_balance_21.txt
22	Petals to the Metal	5	None	00:58:11	2015-08-27	taz_balance_22.txt

24	Petals to the Metal	7	None	00:57:45	2015-09-24	taz_balance_24.txt
25	Petals to the Metal	8	This episode is basically a self-contained Fast and the Furious movie, if that film franchise incorporated actual arcane magicks, rather than just 'movie magic.'	00:59:23	2015-10-22	taz_balance_25.txt
26	Petals to the Metal	9	In this penultimate installment of a race that has gotten wildly, profoundly out of hand, our heroes take on a trio of automotive threats.	01:02:25	2015-11-05	taz_balance_26.txt
27	Petals to the Metal	10	This is it. Our heroes are in a dead heat with The Raven, the finish line in sight. Who will emerge victorious? Who will end up with the mighty Gaia Sash? More importantly, is there any prize money for this thing? Taako does some sunbathing. Magnus gets shredded. Merle executes the weirdest brag ever.	01:08:48	2015-11-19	taz_balance_27.txt
28	Lunar Interlude II: Internal Affairs	1	Our heroes return to the Bureau of Balance’s moonbase after a job kind-of well done. They’ve got a lot waiting for them: A heated debrief, a major change in the payroll and, of course, a visit to everyone’s favorite fantasy bulk shopping outlet.	01:14:32	2015-05-03	taz_balance_28.txt
29	The Crystal Kingdom	1	A new adventure begins! Join our heroes as they host a relatively successful office holiday party, and mourn as that party gets totally sidelined by a potential apocalypse.	01:01:21	2015-12-19	taz_balance_29.txt
30	The Crystal Kingdom	2	Our heroes make their way into Lucas’ floating, crystallized lab, and face off against their deadliest foe yet. Will they thrive under the pressure of an apocalyptic time limit? Or will they waste too much time just standing around, debating the names of members of the band U2?	01:02:04	2015-12-31	taz_balance_30.txt
31	The Crystal Kingdom	3	Having survived an encounter with their deadliest foe yet, our heroes take a moment to reflect on some of Faerun’s most prodigious scientific achievements.	00:59:48	2016-01-14	taz_balance_31.txt
32	The Crystal Kingdom	4	We may have finally found a challenge that our heroes cannot overcome: Math-based trivia. Can our heroes stump their animatronic captor before turning extra crispy? Can they stave off a crystalline death for one more episode? Merle seeks divine intervention. Magnus makes an otherworldly find. Taako’s good out here.	01:03:15	2016-01-27	taz_balance_32.txt
33	The Crystal Kingdom	5	Our heroes face a series of challenges while exploring Lucas’ lab that are, admittedly, all pretty adorable. But still super deadly! Just, like, huggably deadly.	00:58:01	2016-02-11	taz_balance_33.txt
34	The Crystal Kingdom	6	Can our heroes achieve a competent victory against three relatively unkillable foes? More importantly: Can they do any sick stunts while doing so? Taako conjures up the ultimate terror. Magnus has a public service announcement. Merle faces a crystal conundrum.	01:00:36	2016-02-25	taz_balance_34.txt
35	The Crystal Kingdom	7	Our heroes recover after performing some impromptu emergency surgery on their holiest team member, and then, after kicking it for a while, learn the secrets of the universe. No big deal.	01:09:12	2016-03-09	taz_balance_35.txt
36	The Crystal Kingdom	8	Hey, things aren’t really going that great for our heroes right now, but on the plus side — it’s MaxFunDrive time! You can support our show by going to maximumfun.org/donate, though unfortunately, you can’t really support our heroes right now; they’ve got to un-goof this situation themselves.	01:20:58	2016-03-24	taz_balance_36.txt
37	The Crystal Kingdom	9	It’s going down. Our heroes have a thrilling showdown with three of their most deadly, most dead foes — but will they fare as well in Round Two as they did the first time around?	01:03:03	2016-04-06	taz_balance_37.txt
38	The Crystal Kingdom	10	It’s time for the final confrontation. Who’s been hunting our heroes all throughout this campaign? What’s Lucas really after? Why is Merle getting just completely boned in every fight? Answers to these questions and more linger just behind the play button. Taako has a plan. Magnus has a snack. Merle says his prayers.	01:12:24	2016-04-21	taz_balance_38.txt
39	The Crystal Kingdom	11	After a climactic victory, our heroes have a few loose ends to tie up before moving on to their next adventure. Will Lucas and Maureen get Regulated? Will Kravitz claim his undead bounty? More importantly, how are they going to get that big, magic rock out of Magnus’ tummy?	01:12:07	2016-05-04	taz_balance_39.txt
40	Lunar Interlude III: Rest & Relaxation	1	That last adventure was a tough one. Our heroes have earned some time off — both from mortal danger, and from each other. But how do adventurers spend their downtime between jobs? Also, what’s hot and fresh at the bakery counter of the Fantasy Costco?	01:31:13	2016-05-18	taz_balance_40.txt
41	The Eleventh Hour	1	After a fairly morose start to the episode, our heroes are launched — with great speed — into a new adventure. What awaits them inside of the time-stuck anomaly? More important question: Who’s ready for SUMMER FASHIONS?	01:08:09	2016-06-01	taz_balance_41.txt
42	The Eleventh Hour	2	What waits for our heroes on the other side of the time-stuck barrier? Seriously, what could be in there? A dragon made out of time? A parallel universe where people eat time like snack chips? A genuinely kind of innocuous, rustic town? Whatever it is, one thing’s for sure: There’s about to be some trouble in that bubble.	01:09:08	2016-06-16	taz_balance_42.txt
43	The Eleventh Hour	3	Our heroes start to get a hang of the difficult business of repetition as they learn more about Refuge and the events that led the town to such a sorry state. How much catastrophe can they undo in 60 minutes? Certainly they can’t make things worse — can they?	01:10:12	2016-06-29	taz_balance_43.txt
44	The Eleventh Hour	4	Our heroes explore an extremely deadly derelict mine in an attempt to find out what’s happening to Refuge every time the clock strikes noon. They do so with the usual amount of caution and grace, which is to say things go very, very, very poorly, very, very, very often.	01:13:20	2016-07-13	taz_balance_44.txt
45	The Eleventh Hour	5	Now that Refuge’s destroyer has been revealed, our heroes work together to discover a way to stop it. But how many more attempts will they get at solving this, their most deadly mystery yet?	01:03:54	2016-07-27	taz_balance_45.txt
46	The Eleventh Hour	6	If our boys want to get out of this time-locked quagmire, they’re going to need some divine intervention — and the only way to get this particular god to play ball is to get up to no good. Let’s hope that big wheel doesn’t stop turning on this rotation, yeah?	01:24:27	2016-08-10	taz_balance_46.txt
47	The Eleventh Hour	7	With a fairly rowdy loop behind them, our heroes come face-to-face with divinity, and try their darndest not to make complete asses of themselves. With the Big Clock winding down and their prize in sight, can Tres Horny Boys save the day — or, at least, one of the days?	01:10:28	2016-24-08	taz_balance_47.txt
48	The Eleventh Hour	8	Could you resist the power to go back and change your very worst mistake? What if it meant unraveling some of the non-mistakes you’ve made since? Also: Imagine, for the sake of this hypothetical, that you’re a complete goober.	01:15:04	2016-09-07	taz_balance_48.txt
49	The Eleventh Hour	9	Their prize secured, our heroes look to close out their final loop in Refuge by doing something unprecedented: They try to keep everyone in town from exploding, for once.	01:21:14	2016-09-21	taz_balance_49.txt
50	Lunar Interlude IV: The Calm Before the Storm	1	Our heroes have some well-earned free time between missions, although some of their sidequests are a bit more relaxing than others. Enjoy it while it lasts, fellas.	01:34:43	2016-10-05	taz_balance_50.txt
51	The Suffering Game	1	After a summer spent tirelessly training, our heroes are finally prepared to take on their next, harrowing mission. What horrors — or fortunes — await them in Wonderland? I mean, this arc is literally titled “The Suffering Game,” so you can probably piece it together yourself.	01:06:16	2016-10-19	taz_balance_51.txt
52	The Suffering Game	2	Our boys survived their first encounter in The Felicity Wilds — but will they survive the perils that await them inside of Wonderland? Or like, maybe it’s not so bad in there? No, I’m just goofin’. It’s pretty dang bad in there.	01:04:36	2016-11-16	taz_balance_52.txt
53	The Suffering Game	3	Wonderland has revealed itself as a genuinely unsafe place for our heroes to be. Can they make forward progress in a cyclical game designed to extract raw anguish from them? Can they reach their distant goal before they’ve sacrificed too much?	01:17:52	2016-12-15	taz_balance_53.txt
54	The Suffering Game	4	After Round One of The Suffering Game, our heroes aren’t doing too great — and with another turn of the Wheel ahead, the future’s not especially bright, either. Can they keep their heads up (and on) to power through?	01:03:09	2017-01-12	taz_balance_54.txt
55	The Suffering Game	5	Strange things are afoot in Wonderland as our heroes find themselves aided by an invisible accomplice — but will their secret plan pop off before the boys lose something precious to the Wheel?	01:08:50	2017-01-26	taz_balance_55.txt
56	The Suffering Game	6	Our heroes are forced to square off against their deadliest former foes — but their real challenge comes in the form of a danger the likes of which they’ve never experienced. Taako gets primal. Merle gets disconnected. Magnus gets a couple of helping hands.	01:02:24	2017-02-09	taz_balance_56.txt
57	The Suffering Game	7	Game Over. Taako makes some fashionable friends. Merle does some wordplay. Magnus remembers.	01:10:45	2017-02-23	taz_balance_57.txt
58	Lunar Interlude V: Reunion Tour	1	Our heroes’ party has just undergone a fairly shocking expansion. They’re now tasked with an infiltration mission that hits close to home. As the pieces move into place for the endgame, what do our heroes hope to find — and where do their allegiances lie?	01:14:35	2017-03-09	taz_balance_58.txt
59	Lunar Interlude V: Reunion Tour	2	Our heroes are out of time, out of options, out of places to hide. The holes in their history are starting to fill in; but are they going to like the answers they receive? We’re almost caught up, now.	01:45:03	2017-03-23	taz_balance_59.txt
60	The Stolen Century	1	We’re nearly at our journey’s end — but before we can truly understand what lies ahead, we must first return to this story’s true beginning. What brought our heroes together to the crisis they face today? What happened to the memories of their dear, forgotten friends? And just how long have they been running away?	01:34:51	2017-04-13	taz_balance_60.txt
61	The Stolen Century	2	Our heroes find themselves crossing between strange, deadly, beautiful worlds, pursued by a foe they cannot comprehend. Can they grow strong enough to defeat their cosmic enemy? Or will their journey take them down a road from which they can never return?	01:25:41	2017-04-26	taz_balance_61.txt
62	The Stolen Century	3	Our heroes have earned a break, don’t you think? Merle finds a place to settle down. Magnus keeps ’em on their toes. Taako dispenses some beach wisdom.	00:39:25	2017-05-04	taz_balance_62.txt
63	The Stolen Century	4	We’re fairly deep into our trip down memory lane, but our heroes are no closer to figuring out how to stop the ever-evolving force that’s pursuing them. With few other options, they’ll have to adopt a new, remarkably costly strategy.	01:29:13	2017-05-18	taz_balance_63.txt
64	The Stolen Century	5	Our heroes find themselves in a strange world where artists compete for national pride, submitting their works to a mountain that can make them known throughout the land. Can the team create satisfactory masterpieces before their year is up?	01:02:57	2017-06-01	taz_balance_64.txt
65	The Stolen Century	6	The Hunger pursues, and our heroes escape. They’ve been keeping up the chase for decades now, evading without fail. But the Hunger’s getting faster. The journey’s getting harder. The team must take drastic steps, just to stay afloat. We’re nearly caught up, now.	01:23:20	2017-06-15	taz_balance_65.txt
66	The Stolen Century	7	Our heroes’ long, forgotten journey comes to an end.	01:26:53	2017-06-29	taz_balance_66.txt
67	Story and Song: Finale	1	Our heroes’ memories have returned. At the end of everything, will they stand together against the encroaching darkness? Or will their past sins leave them irrevocably driven apart?	01:19:06	2017-07-13	taz_balance_67.txt
68	Story and Song: Finale	2	Two lights shine down from the sky. Their story passes through reality. His song fills their hearts. The world fights back.	01:59:55	2017-08-01	taz_balance_68.txt
69	Story and Song: Finale	3	Our heroes reach their journey’s end.	02:42:08	2017-08-17	taz_balance_69.txt
