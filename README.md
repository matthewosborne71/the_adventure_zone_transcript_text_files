# The Adventure Zone Transcript Text Files

I made this repository to hold text files corresponding to the Adventure Zone's transcripts. I have done this to put the data into a more useable form for analysis. Mainly I wanted to practice some Natural Language Processing techniques using the words from a show that I greatly enjoy.

Original transcript files have been taken from <a href="https://tazscripts.tumblr.com/tazscripts">https://tazscripts.tumblr.com/tazscripts</a>, and edited into the text file format found in this repository by me. Each file has been formatted so that every line contains a single colon (:). Found on the left of each colon is the name of the person/character/entity that was credited as speaking the line on the podcast. On the right of each colon is the text of what was said along with staging notes contained, typically, in square brackets ([]).

Each file corresponds to a single episode of the podcast. Seasons of the podcast will be broken into unique folders.


## Current Progress

The repository is not yet complete. I will update it as I complete each arc of the show. I plan to start with just the Balance campaign, but will likely continue to update with Amnesty, Graduation and Ethersea.

## Final Note

The text files were created by first scraping HTML files and then editing by hand. As such there is the chance for small errors. If I detect any, I will update the files with those errors fixed. Thanks for your understanding!
