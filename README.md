# The Adventure Zone Transcript Text Files

I made this repository to hold text files corresponding to the Adventure Zone's transcript files as found on <a href="https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone">MaximumFun.org</a>. I have done this to put the data into a more useable form for analysis. Mainly I wanted to practice some Natural Language Processing techniques using the words from a show that I greatly enjoy.

In this repository will be a master file that contains episode meta data for each of the text files. Each text file will correspond to an episode of the podcast. Each line of each text file corresponds to a line from one of Clint, Travis, Justin, Griffin or one of the many characters of the show. Each file will also have a few lines of "[theme music plays]" that allow for demarcation of the episode's introduction, and ad breaks.


## Current Progress

The repository is not yet complete. I will update it as I complete each arc of the show. I plan to start with just the Balance campaign, but will likely continue to update with Amnesty, Graduation and Ethersea.

## Publishing Guidelines

I've provided this data with the hope that it would be fun for others.

## Final Note

I'm moving the text from PDF format to txt format. As such there is the chance for small errors. If I detect any, I will update the files with those errors fixed. Thanks for your understanding!
